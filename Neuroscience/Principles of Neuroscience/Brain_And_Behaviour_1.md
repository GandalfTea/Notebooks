Explaining human behaviour in terms of the brain's activities is the task of neural science, and the progress of neural science in explaining human behabiour is a major theme of this book. 

# Two theories that combine the brain with behaviour :

Camillo Golgi developed a method of staining neurons with silver salts that revealed their entire cell structure under the microscope. Using Galgi's technique, Ramon y Cajal discovered that nervous tissue is not a syncytium, a continuous web of elements, but a network of discrete cells. In the course of this work, Ramon y Cajal developed some of the key concepts and much of the early evidence for the NEURON DOCTRINE - the principle that individual neurons are the elementary building blocks and signaling elements of the nervours system. 

Support for this theory came in the 1920s by the american embryologist Ross Harrison, demonstrated that the axon and dandrites grow from within the cell body even when the cell is isolated. Harrison also showed that the tip of the axon gives rise to an expansion, the GROWTH CONE, witch leads the developing axon to its target, either to other nerve cells or muscles.  The final and definite proof of the neuron doctrine came in the mid 1950s with the introduction of the electron miscroscopy. 



The study of the relation between the mind and the body has a deep history in philosophy, with many theories being created over the centuries. An important figure in this study is Franz Joseph Gall who proposed two new ideas :
	1. He advocated that the brain contains the mind, and that all the proceses of the mind are located in the brain. In doing so, he rejected the common idea that brain and mind are separate things, that has been proposed initialy by Rene Descartes in the 17th century, becoming the paradigm at the time.
	
	2. He argued that the brain did not function as a single organ but rather as a bundle of smaller organs, all responsible for one thing. 

Although the ideas were in the right direction, he failed to come up with good enough experiments to prove them and ultimately went astray when he believed that the ridges and bumps of the skull ilustrated a growth in a specific organ that is part of the brain and also the organ's influence of facial features. 


In the 1820s french psysiologist Pierre Flourens decided to put Franz's theory to the test and found the opposite, that all parts of the brain are responsible for all procesed and that injury in one part affects all cognition. Any part of the cerebral hemisphere, Flourence proposed, is able t perform all the hemisphere's functions. This belief was later called the HOLLISTIC VIEW and it was rapidly accepted. 

The rapid social acceptence of this view represents a cultural reaction agains the materialistic view that the human mind is a biological organ and the idea that there is no soul, ideas that were unacceptable to the religious establishment. 


This view was seriously challanges in the mid 19th century when neurologists could trace effect of an epilepric episode to certain parts of the brain.  One of the people against it was Ramon y Cajal who called forward a theory called CELLULAR CONNECTIVISM, that put the neuron as the base building block of the brain. They are arranged in precist groups and arranges in precise fashion. The first important evidence for localization emerges from studies of how the brain processes language. 

Before we consider te relevant clinical and anatomical studies, we shall review the overall structure of the brain : 


# The Brain has Distinct Functional Regions :


The central nervous system is a bilateral ans symetrical structure consisting of two main parts : the brain and the spinal cord. 

The central nervous system can be divided into 7 big parts :

* Spinal Cord
* Brain :
	1. Medulla oblongata
	2. Pons
	3. Cerebellum
	4. Midbrain
	5. Diencephalon
	6. Cerebrum

The cerebral cortex is also divided into four lobes :
	* Temporal
	* Frontal
	* Parietal
	* Occipital

Two important features characterize the organization of the cerebral cortex. One is that each hemisphere is concerned primarily with sensory and motor processes on the opposite side of the body. For example, the sensory information that reaches the spounal cord from the left side of the body crosses to the right side og the nervous system on its way to the cerebral cortex.  The second feature is that the hemispheres, although similar in appearance, are neither completely symmetrical in structure nor equivalent in function.



# The first strong evidence for Localization of Cognitive Abilities came from Studies of Language Disorders.

The first area of the brain that was discovered to be important for cognition was concerned with language. These came from studies of aphasia, a language disorder that often occurs from stroks. Those studies from the 19th century are one of the most important and exciting advancements in neural science and human behaviour. 

Pierre Paul Broca was inspired by Gall's efforts to map higher functions of the brain and followed by corelating clinical evidence of aphasia with brain lesions doscovered post mortem. On this, Broca founded neuropsychology. 

Broca described a pacient who as a result of having a stroke could not speak, although he could understand language perfectly well. This pacient had no motor deficits of the tongue, mouth or vocal cords that would affect his ability to speak. In fact, he could utter isolated words, whistles and sing a melogy without difficulty. But he could not speak gramatically or complete sentences, not expres his ideas in writing. Postmortem examination of the pacient's brain showed a lesion in the posterior region of the frontal lobe, now called BROCA'S AREA. Broca also studied eight similar patients, all with lesions in this region and in each case the legion was located in the left cerebral hemisphere. These experiences lead Broca to announce in 1864 that we speak with the left hemisphere.

His research stimulated other people that went on to discover that stimulating the precentral gyrus in various places lead to involuntary phisical movement of the body. Also they discovered that the left part of the brain controlled the right part of the body and vice versa. Thus, because the right hemisphere is used by most people to write and for other skilled movements, it was declared dominant.

The next step was taken in 1876 by Karl Wernicke, who published a now classic paper called "The Symptom-Complex of Aphasia: A Psychological Study on an Anatomical Basis." In it he described another Aphasia pacient who had a failure to comperhand rather than speak. A receptive as opposed to an expresive malfunction. Moreover, the lesion of this new type was in a different place than the one described by Broca: The lesion occured in the posterior part of the cortex where the temporal lobe meets te parietal and occipital lobes.

On the basis of this discovery, and the work of Broca, Fritsch and Hitzig, Wernicke formulated a neural model of language that attepted to reconcile and extend the two conflicting models of the time. Wernicke proposed that only the most basic of functions are mediated by neurons in specific local areas of the cortex. More complex functions resulted as a combination of these specific parts. He was thus the first to propose the idea of DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING.
