###### What are they?

A transistor is a *semiconductor* device (made from semiconductive material, usually silicone) to amplify, connect or disconnect  power. It has at least three *terminals* for connecting to an external circuit. The current applied to one of the terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the *controlled* (output) power can be higher than the *controlling* (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. 

Most transistors are made from very pure silicon.



###### What they do?

A transistor can use a small signal applied between one pair of its  terminals to control a much larger signal at another pair of terminals. This property is called *gain* the power to increase power). It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, which is  proportional to a weaker input signal and thus, it can act as an [amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier). Alternatively, the transistor can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled [switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch), where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.



###### BJT

A **bipolar junction transistor** (**BJT**) is a type of [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) that uses both [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) and [holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole) as charge carriers. A *bipolar transistor* has terminals labeled **base**, **collector**, and **emitter**. A small current at the base terminal (that is, flowing between the base and the emitter) can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter terminals. Bipolar transistor integrated circuits were the main active devices of a generation of mainframe and mini computers, but most computer systems  now use integrated circuits relying on [field effect transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_effect_transistor). Bipolar transistors are still used for amplification of signals,  switching, and in digital circuits. Specialized types are used for high  voltage switches, for radio-frequency amplifiers, or for switching heavy currents.



###### BJT Formation

A **diode** is a two-[terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(electronics)) [electronic component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_component) that conducts [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current) primarily in one direction (asymmetric [conductance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductance)); it has low (ideally zero) [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance) in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance) in the other.

It is used to control the direction flow of the current in a circuit.

If we now join together two individual signal diodes back-to-back, this  will give us two PN-junctions connected together in series that share a  common **P** or **N** terminal. The fusion of these two diodes produces a three layer, two junction, three terminal device forming the basis of a **Bipolar Junction Transistor**, or **BJT** for short.

Transistors are three terminal active devices made from different  semiconductor materials that can act as either an insulator or a  conductor by the application of a small signal voltage. The transistor’s ability to change between these two states enables it to have two basic functions: “*switching*” (digital electronics) or “*amplification*”  (analogue electronics).There are two basic types of bipolar transistor construction, **PNP** and **NPN**, which basically describes the physical arrangement of the P-type and N-type semiconductor materials from which they are made.

​																										 	A typical bipolar transistor



These three  terminals are known and labelled as the Emitter ( E ), the Base ( B ) and the Collector ( C ) respectively.

Bipolar Transistors are current regulating devices that control the  amount of current flowing through them **from the Emitter to the Collector** terminals **in proportion to the amount of biasing voltage applied to  their base terminal**, thus acting like a current-controlled switch. As a  small current flowing into the base terminal controls a much larger  collector current forming the basis of transistor action.

The principle of operation of the two transistor types PNP and NPN, is exactly the same the only difference being in their biasing and the polarity of the power supply for each type.

The construction and circuit symbols for both the PNP and NPN bipolar transistor are given above with the arrow in the circuit symbol always showing the direction of “conventional current flow” between the base terminal and its emitter terminal. The direction of the arrow  always points from the positive P-type region to the negative N-type  region for both transistor types, exactly the same as for the standard  diode symbol.
