The study of linear algebra involves several types of mathematical objects:

* ___Scalars___ are comprised of just a single number (in contrast to other objects in LA). They are written in italics. When defined, it is specified wahat kind of numbers they are : R - real number, N - natural number.
```
R - Real Numbers are numbers that can represent a distance along a line. They contain all rational numbers, such as integers (-5), fraction (4/3) and irrational numbers (sqrt(2)). 

N - Natural Numbers are numbers that are positive, often used for counting. Controversy surrounds the ideea if it includes 0 or not.

* ___Vectors___ are comprised from an array of numbers. The numbers are arranged in order. We identify each number by it's index in that order. The first element of _x_ is _x1_, second is _x2_, etc. We must also specify what kind of numbers they are. If each element is in _R_, and the vector has _n_ elements, then the vector lies in the set formed by taking the Caresian product of _R_ _n_ times, denoted as _R^n_. When we need to explicitly identify the elements, we write them as a column like so:

We can think of vectors as identifying points in space, with each element giving the cooridinate along a different axis.
